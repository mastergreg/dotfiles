Darkblue awesome theme installation jibber-jabber

INSTALLATION
===============================================================================

This installation-howto assumes that your awesome configuration is placed under
~/.config/awesome. If this is not the case, you most certainly have to make
some changes to the theme-file.

1. Get the theme data

$> wget http://nevious.ch/dump/darkblue_theme.tar.gz

2. Unpack and move to proper location

If you have not yet created your user-specific theme folder, do so now.

$> mkdir ~/.config/awesome/themes/
$> tar xfvz darkblue_theme.tar.gz
$> mv darkblue/ ~/.config/awesome/themes/


3. Edit your rc.lua

Replace (or better comment out) your current theme-load with the following:

beautiful.init(awful.util.getdir("config") .. "/themes/darkblue/theme.lua")

Its very important, that you have loaded the awful- and beatiful library before that.

4. Finish

You may want to check your configuration with `awesome -k`. I only tested it with 
awesome version 3.4.10 (Exploder)...

WALLPAPERS
===============================================================================

The theme will, by default, use a random wallpaper from within the 
darkblue/wallpaper/ directory. You have to put some pictures in there first,
it's empty by default.

Hopefully you enjoy my little theme, if not, i won't be hurt :)
